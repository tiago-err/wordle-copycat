# wordle (copycat)

This repository is my attempt at recreating the viral game [wordle](http://nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). This works more as a proof of concept.
I wanted to test out my skills and learn more about [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) and [tailwindcss](https://v2.tailwindcss.com)

A demo can be played [here](https://wordle-copycat.vercel.app)
